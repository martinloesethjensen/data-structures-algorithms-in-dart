# Challenges

## Challenge 1

Explain the difference between a stack and a queue. Provide two real-life examples
for each data structure.

Stack.
Is like stacking boxes on top of each other. You need to take the top box first if you take a box.
A real application use of this data structure would be an undo feature like with drawing apps that have an undo button.

Queue.
FIFO (first in first out). Imagine a literal queue buying tickets for a movie at a theater.
A real application use of this data structure would be to run operations in a specific order.
Like handling events in order of execution they come in.
